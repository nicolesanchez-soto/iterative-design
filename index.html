                <h1>Allara Health: Messaging Inbox Redesign</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="white-box-actual">

                <p>Allara Health is a virtual care platform designed to support women—primarily between the ages of 20
                    and 40—managing
                    hormonal and metabolic conditions like PCOS. Since the platform centers on digital communication,
                    its messaging system
                    plays a crucial role in how patients connect with their care team. But based on the feedback we
                    received, the current
                    setup is falling short.

                </p>

                <p></p>

                <p> Users described the inbox as confusing and difficult to navigate. Messages are grouped by topic
                    rather than person, and
                    because patients speak with a rotating concierge team instead of a dedicated provider, multiple
                    threads can stack up
                    with similar subject lines but no clear continuity. Add in the lack of filtering and search, and it
                    becomes especially
                    frustrating for people trying to reference important information—like lab results or medication
                    instructions—weeks or
                    months after a conversation took place.
                </p>

                <p></p>

                <p>

                    When you’re already carrying the emotional weight of managing a chronic condition, the interface
                    shouldn't add to your
                    stress. That insight guided everything we did in this redesign: make it easier to find, follow, and
                    manage conversations
                    with care.

                <h1>Sketching and Wireframing</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="white-box-actual">
                <p>
                <p>
                    We began by exploring familiar platforms—texting apps, customer support portals, inboxes—and then
                    created <b>four
                        sets of hand-drawn sketches</b> to brainstorm alternatives. Each sketch proposed a different
                    layout, but across
                    the board, we prioritized:
                </p>

                <p></p>

                <ul style="display: table; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;"">
                    <li><b>Search bars</b> for finding messages quickly</li>
                    <li><b>Filters by concierge and topic</b></li>
                    <li><b>Simplified previews</b> with emphasized subject lines</li>
                    <li>A <b>tab for viewing thread details</b>, attachments, and context</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After reviewing and combining the strongest elements from each design, we created a <b>low-fidelity
                        wireframe in
                        Balsamiq</b>. This version consolidated our ideas into a single, cohesive flow with a clean
                    layout and added
                    clarity around message groupings. One notable change was experimenting with a top navigation bar on
                    desktop for a
                    more modern feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In critique, we received two clear pieces of feedback: <b>the desktop version should maintain a
                        traditional left
                        sidebar navigation</b>, and we should <b>only filter by Concierge, not Provider</b>, to reflect
                    how
                    communication actually works at Allara. These were important reminders to design with technical and
                    organizational
                    realities in mind.

                    Moving into high-fidelity, we focused on translating structure into <b>a polished, interactive
                        experience</b> using
                    Figma. The visual language became more refined, but the core ideas from our wireframe stayed
                    central. Our design
                    aimed to feel both professional and calming—supportive, not sterile.
                </p>
                <p><b>Key features included:</b></p>

                <p></p>
                <ul style="display: table; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
                    <li><b>Search and filter tools</b> for reducing information overload</li>
                    <li>The ability to <b>star and archive messages</b> for easier long-term access</li>
                    <li><b>Thread views grouped by concierge</b> to help users follow conversations with specific team
                        members</li>
                    <li>Clean, scannable <b>message cards</b> with bolded subject lines, timestamps, and clear
                        read/unread states</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These features weren’t added for flash—they directly answered real user frustrations. We designed
                    this prototype not
                    just to look real, but to behave like something someone could use tomorrow.

                <p>
                    During our final critique session, we presented our Hi-Fi prototype and received thoughtful feedback
                    from Liv that
                    helped us reflect on both our design decisions and future possibilities.
                </p>

                <p><b>Color palette:</b> Liv highlighted the importance of avoiding colors that might reinforce
                    stereotypes, such as
                    purples and pinks—especially on a platform designed for women. As a result, we would explore more
                    inclusive and
                    professional tones like black or blue to better align with our values.</p>

                <p><b>Messaging interface:</b> She also noted that our layout strongly resembled an email interface.
                    Moving forward, we
                    would consider either leaning into this format with clearer intent or refining the flow to feel more
                    conversational
                    and approachable.</p>

                <p><b>Feature prioritization:</b> Features such as starring and archiving were flagged as potentially
                    unnecessary for
                    this stage. Liv encouraged us to streamline by focusing on core functionalities that matter most to
                    users—like
                    search and filtering.</p>

                <p><b>Next steps:</b> Had we had more time, we would have incorporated this feedback to further refine
                    visual tone,
                    layout style, and feature prioritization. As a team, we still see opportunities to improve the
                    overall messaging
                    experience with Allara Concierge.</p>

                <p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> Every design detail—no matter how small—shapes how users feel. Liv's insights
                    reminded us that
                    good design means making intentional choices that respect users’ needs, emotions, and contexts.</p>
