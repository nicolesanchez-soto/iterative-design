                <h1>Allara Health: Messaging Inbox Redesign</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="white-box-actual">

                <!-- the issues/concerns -->

                <p>As Allara is a virtual healthcare platform, their main point of contact
                    with users is via their messaging system. The company expressed wishes
                    to redesign their messaging system to better streamline user experience.
                    Concerns that have been raised by patients included difficulty finding
                    past messages due to paor type hierarchy and unclear subject lisnes.

                </p>

                <p></p>

                <p> The way the current messaging process is set-up has users speaking with
                    a concierge team as opposed to an assigned team member, meaning conversations
                    can continue across members or several threads could be open with a certain
                    concierge. The current lack of filtering and organization in the message inbox
                    makes it difficult for users to search for specific messages which has caused
                    users to express frustration.

                </p>

                <p></p>

                <p>

                    Specific restraints we were given were that users cannot create message threads
                    directly with providers, nor are they able to close threads.

            <div class="hero-heading">
                <h1>Sketching and Wireframing</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="white-box-actual">
                <p> We began addressing the issue by doing some research on other messaging platforms
                    we have used on desktop and mobile devices. We reimagined a design with our ideas
                    using rough sketches for how we could compose a new design that addressed some user
                    pain points with the aim to condense them into a single wireframe.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p>

                    Common among all of them were the desire for a search bar, filter buttons, and subject
                    line emphasis. Other ideas we had included ways to organize closed messages, making
                    message previews simpler, and adding an additional tab with easy access to relevant
                    thread information.

                <p>
                    The wireframe model was created using Balsamiq and combined some of the key elements we imagined would 
                    improve on the user pain points. These include restructuring type hierarchies, Topic and Concierge Member 
                    filters, a thread details tab, and an archive feature. With these new features, we were hoping to improve 
                    the organization in a way that would allow users to quickly find important information. This wireframe 
                    sets the foundation for further prototyping and feedback from our stakeholders.

                    During our last meeting, Liv shared some valuable insights on our Hi-Fi prototype. A few key
                    takeaways
                    included:
                </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>

                    <b>Color palette: </b> Liv highlighted the importance of avoiding colors that might reinforce
                    stereotypes
                    like purples and pinks especially on a platform designed for women. As a result, we would explore
                    more inclusive and professional tones like black or blue to better align with our values.
                </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    <b> Messaging interface:</b> She also observed that our messaging layout closely resembles an email
                    interface. Moving forward, we'll either lean into this with stronger reasoning for that design
                    choice or refine the interface to feel more conversational and less "inbox-like."
                </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    <b>Feature prioritization:</b> Features such as starring and archiving were flagged as potentially
                    unnecessary at this stage. Our next nest would be streamlining by removing these and doubling
                    down on core functionalities that matter most to users such as search and organization.
                </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    <b>Next steps:</b> As a team, we also agreed to focus on improving the overall messaging experience
                    with Allara Concierge.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    <b>Key Takeaway: <b> Every Design detail no matter how small plays a role in shaping the user
                            experience.
                            Throughout the course, this takeaway becomes more apparent and Liv's insights served as an
                            important reminder.
